#  Digital Clock using Bash Scripting

# Commands to create clock

date -> will display : (Day) (Month) (Date) (Time) (IST) (Year)

date +%T -> will only display Time: 03:28:04
But we want this command to execute multiple times so that we can get the clock.

Now date +%T; sleep 1; -> this will display time & will hold the terminal for 1s & then next terminal line will appear.

Now time will appear like this:

03:28:04
03:28:05
03:28:06

Now we want to clear the previous time & then display the current time , again clear the terminal & again display , & continue this...

-> clear; date+%T; sleep 1s; clear; date+%T; sleep 1s; clear; date+%T; sleep 1s;

To do this we will run an Infinite loop & add all this commands

while true
do 
	clear
	echo $(date +%T)
	sleep 1s
done


!! Our Clock is Ready. !!
